# Data
> Feel free to generate your own test data that will suit the new package you are creating. When generating new test data, it is important to make sure that it aligns with existing data or new data you plan to create so it becomes easier to join the tables and create relationships for Power BI visualization. For example, using the same students and same schools. To make this process seamless, we recommend integrating OEA standardized schemas. Common education data standards like Caliper, Ed-Fi and SIF allow for data solutions to be built on a common analytical foundation and for a ‘plug and play’ approach to combining data from multiple sources.  [Learn more about how to integrate OEA schemas in your new module](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/schemas).

In this readme file, describe the test data and provide a data dictionary using the table provided below.
