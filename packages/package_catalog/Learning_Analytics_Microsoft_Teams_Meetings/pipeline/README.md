# Pipeline

> Upload the pipeline(s) for ingesting the data into Synapse data lake and automating the various stages of the process. It is recommended that pipelines are uploaded in JSON format so that module users can easily import the pipeline template into their Synapse environment. Also provide a description of each pipeline upload in this readme file.
