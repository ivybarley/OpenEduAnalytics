# Learning Analytics Package

The OEA Learning Analytics Package contains a set of assets that provides a professor or school leader with insights on learners' engagement, academics, use of resources and well-being at a class or course level. 

Data from apps on student digital engagement like Microsoft Education Insights and Microsoft Graph can be combined with other data sources for different Learning Analytics use cases. 

This Learning Analytics package was primarily developed for higher education but can be modified for K-12 scenarios.

1. <ins>Guidance and documentation:</ins> This package provides guidance on the end-to-end process of developing a Learning Analytics use case project through the problem statement and package impact. The [OEA Use Case Documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/docs/use_cases/Open_Education_Analytics_Use_Case_Template_v3.docx) should be completed when developing the production-level implementation of this package, including: how to engage stakeholders in the project, prior research on the use case problem domain and theory, how to map data sources to the theory of the problem, and how to implement Microsoft’s Principles of Responsible Data and AI. <em> It is highly recommended this document be reviewed and completed by any education system considering using this package, and that the documentation be revised to the specific data and decisions for that system’s context. </em>

2. <ins>Technical assets:</ins> Various assets are freely available in this package to help accelerate implementation of Learning Analytics use cases. Assets include pipelines, notebooks for data processing, a sample Power BI dashboard, and data dictionary. See descriptions of technical assets below.

## Problem Statement and Package Impact
With varied modes of learning, learning platforms and learner needs, educators have challenges determining how students engage and learn in a class or course in-person, remotely and in hybrid settings. Due to this, they are not able to efficiently consolidate student learning activities and progress.

**The Learning Analytics package provides assets to empower educators with insights to foster student well-being, drive student engagement and improve learning outcomes.** This package brings together signals on how students learn and complete a course to help educators improve overall class participation. Educators can identify which courses, classes and students have lower or higher levels of engagement and the trends over time.

The assets in this package can be combined with course completion, graduation rates, competency measures, or other outcome data to identify how these patterns relate to learning outcomes.

## Package Setup Instructions
![](https://github.com/ivybarley/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/packages/package_catalog/Learning_Analytics/docs/images/Learning_Analytics_Package_Setup_Instructions.png)

<ins><strong>Preparation:</ins></strong> Ensure you have proper [Azure subscription and credentials](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/framework) and setup [the latest version of the OEA framework](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics#setting-up-oea). This will include the latest version of the [OEA Python class](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/framework/synapse/notebook/OEA_py.ipynb).

1. Examine available data sources. See [below](https://github.com/ivybarley/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/packages/package_catalog/Learning_Analytics#data-sources) for these related data sources. Choose which modules or data sources to implement.
    * This package was developed using the following modules: [Student and School Data Systems](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Student_and_School_Data_Systems), [Microsoft Education Insights](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights), and [Microsoft Graph](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph). 
    * Run each of the module data pipelines to ingest the data into stage 2. 
2. Use the [Digital Engagement Schema pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/schemas/schema_catalog/Digital_Engagement_Schema/pipeline) and process the compatible modules to be ingested. This will combine all module tables into a unified table, and creates a single database for the Power BI dashboard. Visit the [Data](https://github.com/ivybarley/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/packages/package_catalog/Learning_Analytics/data) page for a detailed explanation of its use in the Power BI data model.
3. Import and run the [Learning Analytics pipeline template](https://github.com/ivybarley/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/packages/package_catalog/Learning_Analytics/pipeline).
4. Use the Power BI dashboard to explore the Learning Analytics use case. Note that all pipelines create SQL views which can be accessed via your Synapse workspace Serverless SQL endpoint. Example dashboard concepts and detailed information on the queries are [provided in the Power BI folder](https://github.com/ivybarley/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/packages/package_catalog/Learning_Analytics/powerbi).
      
## Data Sources
This package combines multiple data sources: 
* <strong>Digital Engagement data (from Microsoft Education Insights and Microsoft Graph) </strong>: Application use, type of engagement (log-ins, meeting attendance,  duration, etc), date of the activity, user information of the activities, etc.
* <strong>School Information System (SIS)</strong>: School, class, and roster.

This package can use several [OEA Modules](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules) to help ingest data sources that are typically used to understand patterns seen in Learning Analytics (see below for list of relevant OEA modules). 

| OEA Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Student and School Data Systems](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Student_and_School_Data_Systems) | Fictitious student in-person attendance data. |
| [Microsoft Education Insights](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights) | For Microsoft engagement/activity data, and can be used for SIS data. |
| [Microsoft Graph](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Graph) | For other forms of Microsoft engagement/activity data. |
| [Ed-Fi Data Standards](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/Education_Data_Standards/Ed-Fi) | For typical Student Information System (SIS) data, including rosters, class and demographic information. N.B: The Ed-Fi module creation is still in progress. |

These modules are then combined into single tables based on the types of data contained with them, using the [OEA schemas](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/schemas) to ingest and transform the module data so that only the relevant columns are extracted from the stage 2 data. Below is the list of relevant OEA schema definitions used in this package.

| OEA Schema | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Digital Engagement Schema](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/schemas/schema_catalog/Digital_Engagement_Schema) | For extracting forms of digital engagement into a standardized OEA schema. |
